## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

**Risk Description:**  
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.  

**Control Best Practices:**  
Following the first function of the NIST CSF, *Identify*, Botium Toys must dedicate resources to properly identify and classify assets. This will allow the organization to manage them more effectively and determine the impact of asset loss on business continuity.  

**Risk Score:**  
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8 (High)**, due to lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.  

**Additional Comments:**  
- All employees currently have access to internal data, including cardholder data and customers‚Äô PII/SPII.  
- Encryption is not in place for credit card information that is processed, transmitted, or stored.  
- Least privilege and separation of duties are not implemented.  
- Firewall, antivirus, and data integrity controls exist.  
- No intrusion detection system (IDS) is in place.  
- No backups or disaster recovery plans exist.  
- Password policy is weak and not enforced with centralized management.  
- Privacy policies exist, and GDPR breach notification within 72h is planned.  
- Physical security (locks, CCTV, fire prevention) is sufficient.
